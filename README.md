# 98 cards

Clone of the Android app of the same name, [98 cards](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vdh.ninetyeight.android&hl=en_GB).
Only looks good on laptops and doesn't really work on touch devices
(the screen keeps scrolling for some reason).

Also I tried many different colour schemes and yellow-blue is the most
legible and looks the best IMO.
